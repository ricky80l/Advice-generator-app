## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Here I first tried to create a site that uses an API.
I learned that a request must be instantiated to the server through the XMLHttpRequest () module.
This in turn must be opened and once the JSON file that I receive in response is loaded, I obtain the relative data from it and which I finally pass to the relative fields of the DOM.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/italian/news/fetch-api-come-effettuare-una-richiesta-get-e-una-richiesta-post-in-javascript/) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
